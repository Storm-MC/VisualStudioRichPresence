## About Visual Studio Rich Presence
This project allows you to customize your rich presence according to what you want in real visual studio.

## Features:

- You can use a custom application id.
- You can change the extension types and texts to be displayed.
- You can change the initial rich presence texts.
- You can use 79 file types by default (I've worked hard on that part).
- You can change the behavior of rich presence as:
    - Show / Hide Code Time
    - Show / Hide the project you are working on.
    - Show / Hide the name of the file you are working on.
    - Enable / Disable restart code time.
